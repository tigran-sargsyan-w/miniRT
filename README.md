# miniRT
This project is an introduction to the beautiful world of Raytracing. Once completed you will be able to render simple Computer-Generated-Images and you will never be afraid of implementing mathematical formulas again.

For leaks-check:

valgrind --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all --track-origins=yes ./miniRT scenes/valgrind_check.rt
